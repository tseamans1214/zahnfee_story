There was once a man from Raesfeld.
He had a lovely Hund named Bob.
Bob loved to eat Bratwurst on the couch
While listening to Musik by Rammstein.
For dessert he liked to have a piece of Brot.
He thought the Baeckerei was quite nice.
Bob also likes to visit the Biergarten in the evenings.
The man wore a Dirndl while watching Bob eat.
The man and Bob loved to take rides in the Audi.
The man loved to wear lederhose while speeding down the highway.
Sadly, he was overtaken by a BMW on the audubon.
I love flying into Berlins Flughafen, this airport is interesting because it has Mehlhase running around.
Bob loves chasing the Mehlhase around.
